Tim,

Here's a couple paragraphs I put together for the Bsum. If you need  
more, I could probably think of some other stuff.

*Windows Domain Controller*
------------------------------------
The Windows Domain Controller server is online. All remaining MMT  
Windows users will be migrated onto the new domain over the next few  
weeks. The domain controller provides a centralized mode of  
administration and allows any MMT user to log into any Windows  
computer on the MMT domain with their existing username and password.

All of the MMTs Autodesk Inventor files have been moved onto the new  
Windows server and these files are accessed using AutodeskÕs Vault  
software. The Vault provides a robust method for checking in-and-out  
files and maintaining appropriate permissions.

We are currently evaluating Ôroaming profilesÕ which will permit  
Windows users to store their computer settings and ÔMy DocumentsÕ  
on the server instead of their desktop computer. This will give users  
their same ÔdesktopÕ regardless of which computer at the MMT they  
are logged into.

A centralized backup system for Windows desktops is currently being  
evaluated. This will provide Windows users with automatic backup of  
important documents onto the server on a regular basis.


*Catalog Enhancements*
---------------------------------
Since the roll out of the new observer catalog submission tool, many  
changes and additions have been requested and implemented. A couple  
of the major enhancements are:

    * The ability for the observer to edit catalogs online after they
      have already been submitted.
    * Plotting catalog targets and graphing airmass.
    * Administration page for managing submitted catalogs.
