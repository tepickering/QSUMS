At the beginning of this period, I continued testing hexapod control.

During engineering at the telescope, I tested and commissioned
gspec gui changes to allow multiple clients to red/blue channel spectrograph,
the ccdacq detector interface to azcam science camera (red/blue channel),
the ccdacq instrument interface to red/blue channel spectrograph, and
the ccdacq telescope interface to telstat.

I also implemented computer control of comparison lamps,
(many thanks to Cory and Brian for their electronics work), and
made a ccdacq interface to the lamps.
This was tested and successfully used during a recent blue channel run.

During this period, I also investigated using LDAP for unix account passwords,
web page passwords, and samba account password.  The lack of LDAP support
in gdm was a show stopper for now.

I also made some minor changes to ccdacq to prepare for the new red channel.
The changes involved moving some initialization code out of the client and into
the server.  These changes were tested and used during a recent
blue channel run.

October 15-18, I attended ADASS conference in Tucson.

I have started working on replacing windx cell guis with php/ajax web pages.
