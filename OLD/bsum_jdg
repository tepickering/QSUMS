Tom -

This is a quick and dirty input for the bsum.  Let me
know if you need more info on any of the items.

Cheers, Duane.
--------------------------------------------------------

Software efforts focused in three areas:

1)	Implementation of a new web-based catalog submittal,
verification, and viewing system for observers,

2)	Initiation of work on a new scope/catalog graphical
user interface for the telescope operators, and

3)	support of issues related to the hexapod and thermal
systems.	


1) Implementation of a new web-based catalog submittal
form:

A new web page was created using HTML and PHP for MMT
observers to submit, verify, and view catalogs.  The
submitted catalogs reside on an MMT server.  Options are
available on the web page for updating and deleting
previously submitted catalogs.   Individual catalogs can
be viewed in a spreadsheet-format on the web page and
sorted by any of the following data fields:  object name,
right ascension, declination, magnitude, or spectral
type.  Small portions of the catalog can also be viewed. 
This web page is currently being incorporated into a set
of web pages for each observer to obtain and submit
information related to their upcoming MMT projects.

2) Initiation of an new scope/catalog graphical user
interface:

Work was initiated on a new scope/catalog graphic user
interface (GUI) for the operators.  Development of this
GUI proceeded using C/Gtk+ because of the need for fast
computation for large astronomical catalogs and for
access to the more sophisticated widgets available in
Gtk+.  A prototype was developed to the extent of loading
in large catalogs into a spreadsheet-like GUI, sorting
catalogs on selected columns, and implementing
drag-and-drop between catalogs.  This work led to
investigation of the open-source Xephem software
available from Clear Sky Institute, Inc..  Modifications
were made to Xephem to allow the telescope operator to
point-and-click on a displayed object and either: 1) add
that object to a MMT-format catalog, or 2) move the
telescope to the selected object.

3)  Hexapod and thermal system support:

A considerable amount of time was spent on analyzing
issues that arose on the hexapod (including focusing and
collimation) and thermal systems after the telescope came
back on-line in January.  Many of these issues, such as
persistent alarms with the Carrier cooling unit, freezing
of the Neslab cooling unit, and erroneous LVDT readings
from the hexapod, are still being addressed.  A purchase
order is in progress to repair and upgrade the Carrier so
that it can operate at sub-freezing temperatures.  This
will reduce the cooling load on the Neslab.  Software and
operator procedures were modified to reduce icing and
overloading problems for the Neslab.  Hardware
modifications were make on the LVDT for Actuator 1 for
the hexapod.
