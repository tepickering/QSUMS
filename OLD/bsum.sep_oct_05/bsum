			    All-Sky Camera

The all-sky camera was brought back on-line after installing fiber
links for the video and RS232 feeds.  The extra level of digitization
proved not to be an issue for video image quality.  In fact, replacing
the long run of coaxial cable seems to have improved quality
somewhat.  While the camera was off-line, the field-of-view and focus
adjustments on the lens were tweaked to better match the size of the
detector.  The focus also is improved a little bit from before.  Once
back on the sky images were analyzed to build a new mapping between
elevation and azimuth and sky camera image coordinates.  The increase
in field size changed the pixel scale from 2.94 pixels/degree to 3.2.
The 2nd and 3rd order terms to convert zenith angle to radius from
image center are same within the uncertainties and the offset between
azimuth and image angle changed from 10.2 to 12.9 degrees.  The RMS
scatter of the transformation fit across the image remains a little
over 2 pixels.
