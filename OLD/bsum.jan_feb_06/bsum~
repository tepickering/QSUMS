		      F/9 Open Loop Corrections

Since we didn't have any dedicated engineering time to refine f/9's
open loop parameters, they had to be refined over time using WFS data.
When the WFS is finished applying corrections, it logs elevation, the
OSS temperatures, and the hexapod's platform coordinates.  These data
from multiple nights are then combined and each platform coordinate
modeled with a function of the form:

f(el,T) = a*cos(el) + b*sin(el) + c*T + d

where el is the elevation and T is the average OSS temperature.  We
have been doing similar analysis to build the open loop tools for f/5,
but this is the first opportunity since our extended shutdown to do
likewise for f/9.  

The results of analyzing the f/9 WFS data from Jan 31 through March 2
are shown in Figure 1.
