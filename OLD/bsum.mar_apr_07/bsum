		       MMT Pointing Performance

On the night of March 12-13, 2007 we performed a pointing run to try
and verify the systematic azimuth-dependent pointing errors we have
been observing.  We used one of the Hecto fiber positioner robot
cameras and observed a set of 59 stars.  Open loop hexapod corrections were
applied before each observation.  The results were analyzed with
TPOINT using the standard set of terms for an Alt/Az telescope.  The
best fit solution is:

       coeff       change     value    sigma

  1     IA         -0.042  +1193.56    2.352
  2     IE         -0.237     +0.59    0.534
  3     NPAE       -0.072     -1.90    3.327
  4     CA         +0.076    +11.23    3.875
  5     AN         +0.011     -2.55    0.182
  6     AW         -0.002    -12.26    0.176
  7     TF         +3.785     +9.21    1.956
  8     TX         -1.129     -3.95    0.869

Sky RMS =   1.22
Popn SD =   1.31

For reference, the model that we had been using was derived from
pointing data obtained in January, 2004.  The best fit terms from it
are:

       coeff       change     value    sigma

  1     IA         +0.001  +1193.31    1.895
  2     IE         -0.001     -1.54    0.498
  3     NPAE       -0.001     -4.57    2.235
  4     CA         +0.000     +8.81    2.664
  5     AN         +0.001     -3.33    0.226
  6     AW         +0.001    -16.03    0.224
  7     TF         +0.010    +13.55    1.246
  8     TX         -0.008     -5.59    0.319

Sky RMS =   1.59
Popn SD =   1.70

There are slight variations between the 2004 and 2007 models, but
nothing significant enough to explain the errors we have observed.  In
fact, in the course of doing the pointing run it was obvious from
where the stars appeared on the camera as we went around in azimuth
that there is a signficant harmonic error that the Alt/Az model alone
does not account for.  This can be seen in the plots shown in Figure
1.

In looking through the TPOINT software installation on hacksaw, it was
found that there exists a procedure called 'MMT' that implements an
Alt/Az model plus several harmonic terms as functions of Alt and Az.
This was likely leftover from when TPOINT's author, Pat Wallace, did
some consulting for the pre-upgrade MMT.  Since we're still using the
same mount and rotary encoders, it seemed likely that this model is
still relevant.  Modeling the March 2007 pointing data with this
procedure produced the following results:

       coeff       change     value    sigma

  1     IE         +0.000    +17.06    2.543
  2     IA         -0.000  +1194.12    1.567
  3   & HACA2      -0.000     -0.10    0.285
  4   & HACA4      +0.000     +0.09    0.261
  5   & HZCZ       +0.000    +16.45    2.183
  6   & TF         -0.000     +9.87    1.559
  7     NPAE       +0.026     -1.03    2.297
  8     CA         +0.000    +10.25    2.644
  9   & HZSA       -0.000     +0.87    0.238
 10   & HZSA2      -0.000     +0.47    0.152
 11   & HZSA3      -0.000     +1.23    0.173
 12     AW         -0.000    -11.76    0.187
 13     AN         -0.000     -2.38    0.121

Sky RMS =   0.80
Popn SD =   0.90

A very significant improvement in the sky RMS and population standard
deviation to better than an arcsecond RMS!  Note the size of term #8,
specifically, which is a Az error that is proportional to cos(Az).
Experimenting with different mixes of harmonic terms yielded slightly
better results, but not significantly so.  A larger pointing run with
better sky coverage would help determine which harmonic terms we
really need.  Also, when the new servo system is implemented we may
need to do different tweaks to the TPOINT model to reflect the changes
due to using the tape vs. rotary encoders for position information.  It
will require some effort to implement a more sophisticated TPOINT
model into our mount software, but the payoff will likely be RMS
pointing errors less than 2/3 what they are now and overall pointing
performance that would be the envy of most other large telescopes.

			Observer Catalog Tool

The MMT Observer's Catalog Tool has been significantly enhanced.  Some
of its key features include:

* Observers catalog entries are displayed on top of All Sky Camera as
  colored dots and updated in real-time.
* Air mass and elevation are plotted over a 12 hour period for all
  catalog entries.
* Wind direction and speed are continuously updated.
* Azimuth and DEC skycam overlay can be toggled on and off.
* Every observer who submits a catalog via the MMT Catalog Submission
  website automatically receives a link to view their catalog using this
  new tool.
* Runs in a web browser and compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.
  It takes advantage of the capabilities provided by the Flash 9
  plug-in from Adobe. 

MMTO staff can view and use this tool via
http://hacksaw.mmto.org/catalogs/skycam/admin.php from within the MMTO
network.  Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the tool.

Observer Catalog Tool.


		  SCCS/ICE Modifications and Updates

Further work was done to upgrade the Red and Blue Channel spectrograph
control software.  More functionality was moved from the client to the
server.  For the sake of comparison, two different browser-based GUI
clients were built.  The first was built using Java's native GUI
toolkits and runs in a web browser as an applet.  The second was also
built in Java, but used the Google Web Toolkit (GWT;
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) to create an HTML+javascript
interface from the Java code.  The applet method works well, but
requires that the java plugin, which is not included in the base OS,
be installed and maintained on mountain machines.  It is also not as
easily integrated into our OS updating/installing scheme as other 3rd
party plugins such as Adobe's Flash.  However, these issues have been
worked around in the past to support applet-based satellite image
viewers and the new applet-based cell GUIs.  The GWT method generates
HTML+javascript code that can support almost any modern browser with
no need for any extra plugins.  The resulting interface loads quickly
and works fairly well.  However, this is done at the expense of
functionality in the provided interface widgets (e.g. the lack of a
spinner widget for entering floating point values) and greater
complexity in back-end implementation.  For example, the java applet
can communicate directly with the spectrograph server using the SOAP
protocol whereas the GWT interface must communicate via its own RPC
protocol to java code running on a server which then relays the
request to the spectrograph server.  This has been implemented using
the Tomcat5 to run the server-side java code on hacksaw.  Tomcat5 is
well-supported by the OS that we use and was not difficult to
configure to run the GWT server-side code, but seems to be an overly
complicated solution to the problem at hand.  Further testing is
ongoing and the new SCCS server/client software should be deployed by
this summer.  

Mike Lesser fixed some bugs in the AzCam server software that is used
by the Blue and Red Channel CCDs.  These changes required some
modifications to our ICE interface.  These were implemented and tested
so that pausing and resuming exposures should now work reliably for
both the Red and Blue Channel CCDs.  

The motor servos for the f/9-f/15 hexapod were tested and tuned to
reduve the following error, just as was done previously with the f/5
hexapod.  A similar increase in performance was observed and it is now
possible to make smooth focus adjustments during exposures that do not
significantly degrade image quality.


	 Data Mining All-Sky Camera Data for Transient Events

All sky camera data can now be processed with one IDL program,
ntransient_search.  Difference images are now computed on-the-fly in
the program, eliminating the need to store difference frames on disk.
The sky camera image acquisition software now stores data with North
up and East to the left and the data archived on hacksaw has been
modified to match this which eliminates the need to flip images for
display purposes.  The program now checks the phase of the moon and
its elevation as well as the sun's elevation in order to determine
what images to exclude from processing.  Tables are produced
containing moving objects tracked frame to frame (aircraft),
stationary objects of one - two frames (meteors), and stationary
objects over multiple frames (usually bogus detections).  Cloudiness
is still an issue.  Although photometry on the raw frames may indicate
the level of cloudiness in areas of bright sources, in many cases it
may vary substiantially across the frame.

Although IDL is a perfect environment for prototyping the transient
search program, a batch program implemented in C will better serve in a
production environment because it will execute faster and no IDL
license will be required.  We have acquired the Slalib, a collection of
C routines for positional astronomy from Patrick Wallace, RAL.  Routines
in this library will replace the IDL routines from the Astron library
for computing the sun and moon position and the moon phase as well 
as providing many useful astronomical routines for other applications.  
I am investigating two open source implementations of the Hough Transform, 
one in the Gandalf package and the XHoughtool.  If one of these routines
is viable for our needs it would be preferable to developing a new Hough
transform from scratch.


			    Committee Work

Betty Stobie participated in the definition of the 2007 program for
the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems Conference
including the selection of special topics, guest speakers, and
tutorials.

She continued to review multiple iterations of and suggest revisions for
the Definition of the Flexible Image Transport System document as a member
of the IAU FITS Working Group Technical Panel.

Connie Walker, an astronomer with the NOAO Education and Public
Outreach Office, sought Betty's help in debugging their TLRBSE Solar
Spectra Data Analysis Package developed in IDL.  There were two
logistical problems with the reading of the raw data and the
processing of extracted spectra.  The problems were easy to diagnose
and workarounds were provided for both. 


		    M1 Thermal System Performance

We used Betty Stobie's batch_temp tool to analyze snapshots of M1
thermal data that are captured during the course of acquiring WFS
data.  The motivation was to see if different approaches to
controlling the thermal system yielded measurable differences in
thermal system performance.  The nights of March 6-7, 2007 and March
11-12, 2007 provide a good case study for comparison.  Both nights
used the F/5 plus Hectochelle configuration and had fairly stable
conditions.  For March 6-7, a constant offset of approximately -6.5C
from chamber ambient temperature was used for the Carrier chiller's
setpoint.  For March 11-12, the offset from chamber ambient was
changed every 1-2 hours.

The batch_temp tool analyzes the mirror temperature state by fitting a
set of Zernike polynomials to the E-series thermocouple data.  The
results of finite element modeling are used to generate predicted
mirror surface distortions from the temperature fits.  For the
purposes of the current comparison the surface distortion modes that
correspond to wavefront defocus and spherical aberration are the most
salient.  They provide a measure of symmetric, radially-dependent
temperature variations.  The predicted focus error term actually has
two components.  One is a bulk term that correlates with the mean
temperature so that a completely isothermal mirror would have a
predicted focus error of -21 * T(mean) microns.

The batch_temp results for the two nights are shown below:

The first thing to note is that the mirror is well within its
isothermality spec in each of these cases.  At worst the temperature
RMS is 0.16 C and at best it's 0.05 C which is very, very good!  The
second thing to note is that the performance with the Carrier setpoint
automatically kept at -6.5 C below chamber ambient produces results
that are at least as good, if not better than, manual control by the
operator.  Based on these results, a new "carrier_auto" script was
written that sets the Carrier temperature to a constant offset from a
selected ambient temperature, usually from the chamber.  Further
evaluation of M1 thermal behavior during use of this script needs to
be done, but the initial results are very promising.  If the script is
implemented for normal operations, it would eliminate the need for
operator input for M1 thermal control except in abnormal weather
conditions, such as high humidity or dewpoint.

Other work on the M1 thermal control system involved revising the Carrier
control web interface, adding additional possible reference temperatures,
such as the Yankee thermohygrometer.


		       Meteorological Equipment

The Yankee thermohygrometer was moved from the telescope chamber to the
elevator shaft on the roof outside of the building.  This move would
allow the Yankee unit to be used as an accurate indicator for outside
dewpoint prior to opening the chamber.  However, soon after this move,
systematic oscillations in dewpoint and temperature values were observed
for the Yankee unit.  The unit has been returned to the manufacturer for
servicing and calibration.  The unit should be returned within a month.


		       MMTO Balance Calculator

The "balancer" web page was updated to include a new MySQL database and
associated web pages.  The new MySQL database was created on hacksaw with
tables for: 

1) moments for different secondaries, instruments and other telescope
   attachments 
2) observed telescope configurations as well as the associated
   counterweight settings and elevation motor drive currents
3) calculated configurations for hypothetical telescope configurations

Four new web pages have been created including the telescope balance
calculator and tabular views of the moments, observed configurations, and
calculated configurations database tables.


		    MMT Mirror Coating Performance

J.D. Gibson continued work with R Ortiz on a new MySQL database and
web pages for aluminum reflectivity and scattering data from the MMT
primary, secondaries, and aluminization reference samples.  Separate
tables were created for raw, corrected, and averaged data for the
primary mirror, F/5 and F/9 secondary mirrors and the MMT SS1 and 4-in
witness standards.  These table contain light reflectivity and
scattering data for varying wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometers, in
10 nanometer intervals, over the past few years.  The data is
currently being reviewed for quality assurance.  Web pages were
created for charting of reflectance and scattering data versus
wavelength and versus time.


		     Misc. Software-related Tasks

- Revised the "rerr" web page viewer (again) to limit the number of
  displayed lines and to prevent performance issues for large log files. 
  Changes were made to the cell crate code to reduce the size of logs.

- Added MySQL logging of newly published cell variables for the X, Y, Z,
  TX, TY, and TZ platform parameters (in millimeters).  Additional cell
  status parameters for bump status, bump warnings, and bump errors were
  added to the cell crate and to the MySQL background logging for the cell.

- Did additional work on the MMT system status web page.  Rather that
  using the code as a web page, we are currently considering creating a new
  'service' from this code that would automatically send emails to the
  appropriate people when problems arise.

- Supplied thermal data to Gabor Furesz for evaluation with F/5 data with
  Hectochelle.

- Set up a MySQL database table for the cell, hexapod, and mount crate
  event logs.  Dallan is working on a new 'logger' socket server, inputting
  data into this event_log database table, and web interfaces to these logs.

- TempTrax digital thermometer probes were added for the Drive room at
  the MMT and for the MMTO web server room downtown.
