			Observer Catalog Tool

The MMT Observer's Catalog Tool has been significantly enhanced.  Some
of its key features include:

* Observers catalog entries are displayed on top of All Sky Camera as
  colored dots and updated in real-time.
* Air mass and elevation are plotted over a 12 hour period for all
  catalog entries.
* Wind direction and speed are continuously updated.
* Azimuth and DEC skycam overlay can be toggled on and off.
* Every observer who submits a catalog via the MMT Catalog Submission
  website automatically receives a link to view their catalog using this
  new tool.
* Runs in a web browser and compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.
  It takes advantage of the capabilities provided by the Flash 9
  plug-in from Adobe. 

MMTO staff can view and use this tool via
http://hacksaw.mmto.org/catalogs/skycam/admin.php from within the MMTO
network.  Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the tool.

		  SCCS/ICE Modifications and Updates

Further work was done to upgrade the Red and Blue Channel spectrograph
control software.  More functionality was moved from the client to the
server.  For the sake of comparison, two different browser-based GUI
clients were built.  The first was built using Java's native GUI
toolkits and runs in a web browser as an applet.  The second was also
built in Java, but used the Google Web Toolkit (GWT;
http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) to create an HTML+javascript
interface from the Java code.  The applet method works well, but
requires that the java plugin, which is not included in the base OS,
be installed and maintained on mountain machines.  It is also not as
easily integrated into our OS updating/installing scheme as other 3rd
party plugins such as Adobe's Flash.  However, these issues have been
worked around in the past to support applet-based satellite image
viewers and the new applet-based cell GUIs.  The GWT method generates
HTML+javascript code that can support almost any modern browser with
no need for any extra plugins.  The resulting interface loads quickly
and works fairly well.  However, this is done at the expense of
functionality in the provided interface widgets (e.g. the lack of a
spinner widget for entering floating point values) and greater
complexity in back-end implementation.  For example, the java applet
can communicate directly with the spectrograph server using the SOAP
protocol whereas the GWT interface must communicate via its own RPC
protocol to java code running on a server which then relays the
request to the spectrograph server.  This has been implemented using
the Tomcat5 to run the server-side java code on hacksaw.  Tomcat5 is
well-supported by the OS that we use and was not difficult to
configure to run the GWT server-side code, but seems to be an overly
complicated solution to the problem at hand.  Further testing is
ongoing and the new SCCS server/client software should be deployed by
this summer.  

Mike Lesser fixed some bugs in the AzCam server software that is used
by the Blue and Red Channel CCDs.  These changes required some
modifications to our ICE interface.  These were implemented and tested
so that pausing and resuming exposures should now work reliably for
both the Red and Blue Channel CCDs.  

The motor servos for the f/9-f/15 hexapod were tested and tuned to
reduve the following error, just as was done previously with the f/5
hexapod.  A similar increase in performance was observed and it is now
possible to make smooth focus adjustments during exposures that do not
significantly degrade image quality.


	 Data Mining All-Sky Camera Data for Transient Events

All sky camera data can now be processed with one IDL program,
ntransient_search.  Difference images are now computed on-the-fly in
the program, eliminating the need to store difference frames on disk.
The sky camera image acquisition software now stores data with North
up and East to the left and the data archived on hacksaw has been
modified to match this which eliminates the need to flip images for
display purposes.  The program now checks the phase of the moon and
its elevation as well as the sun's elevation in order to determine
what images to exclude from processing.  Tables are produced
containing moving objects tracked frame to frame (aircraft),
stationary objects of one - two frames (meteors), and stationary
objects over multiple frames (usually bogus detections).  Cloudiness
is still an issue.  Although photometry on the raw frames may indicate
the level of cloudiness in areas of bright sources, in many cases it
may vary substiantially across the frame.

Although IDL is a perfect environment for prototyping the transient
search program, a batch program implemented in C will better serve in a
production environment because it will execute faster and no IDL
license will be required.  We have acquired the Slalib, a collection of
C routines for positional astronomy from Patrick Wallace, RAL.  Routines
in this library will replace the IDL routines from the Astron library
for computing the sun and moon position and the moon phase as well 
as providing many useful astronomical routines for other applications.  
I am investigating two open source implementations of the Hough Transform, 
one in the Gandalf package and the XHoughtool.  If one of these routines
is viable for our needs it would be preferable to developing a new Hough
transform from scratch.


			    Committee Work

Betty Stobie participated in the definition of the 2007 program for
the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems Conference
including the selection of special topics, guest speakers, and
tutorials.

She continued to review multiple iterations of and suggest revisions for
the Definition of the Flexible Image Transport System document as a member
of the IAU FITS Working Group Technical Panel.

Connie Walker, an astronomer with the NOAO Education and Public
Outreach Office, sought Betty's help in debugging their TLRBSE Solar
Spectra Data Analysis Package developed in IDL.  There were two
logistical problems with the reading of the raw data and the
processing of extracted spectra.  The problems were easy to diagnose
and workarounds were provided for both. 



1)  Compared M1 glass temperature data and related wavefront sensor data
for two different nights of f/5, hectochelle operations: the night of
March 6-7, 2007 and the night of March 11-12, 2007.  Different approaches
were used to control the M1 ventilation system and Carrier chiller during
these two nights.  For March 6-7, a constant offset of approximately -6.5C
from chamber ambient temperature was used for the Carrier setpoint.  For
March 11-12, the offset from chamber ambient was changed every 1-2 hours.

M1 mirror temperatures and wavefront-sensor spherical aberration
corrections were then compared for the two nights.

The data for March 6-7, 2007 is as follow:

The data for March 11-12, 2007 is as follow:
#Time-GMT      Focus     Spherical Aberration      Mean Temp     RMS(Temp)
 02:20:28    -104.798              214.6              6.74         0.155

Based on the similarity of RMS temperature errors for the two nights, a
new "carrier_auto" script was written that sets the Carrier temperature to
a constant offset from an ambient temperature.  This script can be run in
a background mode and automatically adjust the Carrier setpoint every 60
seconds, as needed.  Data from the two nights of hectochelle observing
suggest that this approach, which completely eliminates telescope operator
input on M1 thermal control, may be as good as an approach involving
direct human input for the M1 thermal system control.   M1 thermal
behavior during use of this script needs to be tested and evaluated.  If
the script is implemented for normal operations, it would eliminate the
need for operator input for M1 thermal control except in abnormal weather
conditions, such as high humidity or dewpoint.

Although these two nights had similar instrumentation (f/5 secondary,
hectochelle, f/5 wfs and corrector) and, in general, similar weather
conditions, the focus errors for March 11-12 vary by more than 100 um
while the mean temperature only varies 0.6C.  This suggests that other
factors besides temperature are involved in the changing focus values.

Other work on the M1 thermal control system involved revising the Carrier
control web interface, adding additional possible reference temperatures,
such as the Yankee thermohygrometer.

2) Moved the Yankee thermohygrometer from the telescope chamber to the
elevator shaft on the roof outside of the building.  This move would
enable the Yankee unit be used as an accurate indicator for outside
dewpoint prior to opening the chamber.  However, soon after this move,
systematic oscillations in dewpoint and temperature values were observed
for the Yankee unit.  The unit has been returned to the manufacturer for
servicing and calibration.  The unit should be returned within a month.

3) Updated the "balancer" web page to include a new MySQL database and
associated web pages.  The new MySQL database was created on hacksaw with
tables for: 1) moments for different secondaries, instruments and other
telescope attachments, 2) observed telescope configurations as well as the
associated counterweight settings and elevation motor drive currents, and
3)  calculated configurations for hypothetical telescope configurations. 
Four new web pages have been created including the telescope balance
calculator and tabular views of the moments, observed configurations, and
calculated configurations database tables.

4) Continued work with R Ortiz on a new MySQL database and web pages for
aluminum reflectivity and scattering data from the MMT primary,
secondaries, and aluminization reference samples.  Separate tables were
created for raw, corrected, and averaged data for the primary mirror, F/5
and F/9 secondary mirrors and the MMT SS1 and 4-in witness standards. 
These table contain light reflectivity and scattering data for varying
wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometers, in 10 nanometer intervals, over
the past few years.  The data is currently being reviewed for quality
assurance.  Web pages were created for charting of reflectance and
scattering data versus wavelength and versus time.

5) Provided input for software-related items for the Program Plan.

6) Revised the "rerr" web page viewer (again) to limit the number of
displayed lines and to prevent performance issues for large log files. 
Changes were made to the cell crate code to reduce the size of logs.

7) Added MySQL logging of newly published cell variables for the X, Y, Z,
TX, TY, and TZ platform parameters (in millimeters).  Additional cell
status parameters for bump status, bump warnings, and bump errors were
added to the cell crate and to the MySQL background logging for the cell.

8) Did additional work on the MMT system status web page.  Rather that
using the code as a web page, we are currently considering creating a new
'service' from this code that would automatically send emails to the
appropriate people when problems arise.

9) Supplied thermal data to Gabor Furesz for evaluation with F/5 data with
Hectochelle.

10) Set up a MySQL database table for the cell, hexapod, and mount crate
event logs.  Dallan is working on a new 'logger' socket server, inputting
data into this event_log database table, and web interfaces to these logs.

11) TempTrax digital thermometer probes were added for the Drive room at
the MMT and for the MMTO web server room downtown.
