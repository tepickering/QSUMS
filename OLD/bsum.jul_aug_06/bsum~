	      Hexapod Control and Performance Evaluation

Tom Trebisky, Duane Gibson, and Skip Schaller worked to deploy and
test new hexapod code to move all the motors in a coordinated fashion.
This should ensure that a motion only in the focus direction will not
make the image of the star move around in the field during the motion.
We discovered various anomalies in both hexapods during the release
and application of the brakes as well as other erratic behavior of the
pods.  This discovery led to more detailed evaluation of hexapod
performance.  

This evaluation included comparing and contrasting coordinated and
uncoordinated motion, the release and application of brakes and servo
control during each move, and the trajectory of motion for each pod
during a move.  Data was collected at different telescope elevations
and with different payloads on the hexapods.  New data acquisition and
analysis tools have been developed for logging hexapod data at 1Hz, a
higher resolution than has been available in the past.  Real-time
visualization tools have also been developed as part of this testing.
We still need to do more daytime testing as well as on-sky tests
during upcoming engineering nights.


Updates to Blue/Red Channel Image Acquisition and Spectrograph Control
			       Software

I wrote a new ICE interface to the AZCAM detector system,
testing it briefly with the guide camera.  It is now under
test in the downtown lab with the science camera system
for the red and blue channel controllers.

I wrote a new ICE telescope interface to the MMT telescope control
system, using SOAP via the telstat server, bypassing a more
complex, and apparently unreliable route to the same information.

I modified the control software for the red and blue channel
spectrograph, separating it into client and server pieces.
The server can handle multiple clients.  I wrote an ICE instrument
interface to this new server.  ICE can now control spectrograph
functions, as well as, fill in header information with spectrograph
values.


			   Hexapod Offsets

Work is underway on incorporating different types of hexapod/secondary
mirror offsets into a more systematic approach to improve hexapod control,
trend analysis, and data mining.  Unique hexapod offsets have been
defined for instruments, thermal-dependent effects,
elevation-dependent effects, guiders, and wave-front sensors.  Input
from the telescope and instrument operators are captured into their
own separate offsets.  

In the past, these various hexapod offsets have been lumped together,
making analysis of individual effects on hexapod location and behavior
difficult.  This functionality has now been implemented in the hexapod
crate code and is available through the "remote" network protocol. 
Further work is needed to augment the "msg" protocol to handle these
offsets.  A new web-based graphic user interface is also being developed
and is ready for testing.  Modifications were made to the existing
"settings" server to include the various offsets and to improve the XML
format of the stored data.


	      Hexapod/UMAC/VME Servicing/Troubleshooting

The UMAC CPU was replaced because of communication failures.  We are
also addressing an intermittent "Tape Status" error.


			   GUI's/Web Pages

Work continues on creating new and improving existing web pages and GUI's.
A new PHP class, "xajaxMMT", was created to centralize MMT-specific
PHP/Ajax functionality.  This class extends the PHP class,
"xajaxResponse", of the xajax PHP/javascript library (see
http://www.xajaxproject.org/).  The new xajaxMMT class: 1) minimizes web
server/browser communication by only sending new values to the web
browser, and 2) provides class methods for common MMT GUI functionality,
such as changing background color based on system status.  The existing
Miniserver PHP class was also augmented to allow active control of
essentially all network-based MMT hardware, including the mount, hexapod,
and cell crates.  Methods for interacting with the settings server were
also added to the Miniserver class.

Thermal web pages that use these two PHP classes have been created for
Carrier chiller and Pit Neslab chiller control.  Other thermal web pages,
such as for the thermal transect and the Vaisala WXT510 status web page,
are also now using this technology.


		      DT3155 Framegrabber Driver

In early July it was discovered that the framegrabber driver and thus
the SAOguider had quit working.  It had worked fine with the 2.6.12
and 2.6.14 kernels, but did not work at all with 2.6.16 or newer
ones.  The driver would build and install fine and generated no
runtime errors, but SAOguider and other framegrabber tasks would hang
up.  A key hint to the root of the problem came from the fact that
one of the test programs that comes with the DT3155 driver did work.
There are two ways to grab frames from the DT3155:  by polling the
card until it's in a frame-ready state or by having the card generate
interrupts when frames are ready.  The SAOguider and our software use
the interrupt mode while the test program that worked used the polling
mode.  Thus the driver and card were fine, but the card was not
generating interrupts for some reason.  Checking /proc/interrupts
while attempting to grab frames in interrupt mode confirmed this to be
the case.  Further testing found that the more recent kernels were
configured to use the more modern IO-APIC interrupt controller for all
interrupts while the older ones used the legacy XT-PIC mode for the
DT3155.  Forcing the newer kernels into the legacy XT-PIC mode via the
'noapic' boot parameter got the DT3155 working again in all modes.
Under a heavy interrupt load there can be a performance penalty
when using the XT-PIC mode, but it's not enough to be a concern for
us.  The machines such as hoseclamp that host DT3155 cards have had
their boot configurations modified to include the 'noapic' flag and
the SAOguider now works properly. 


	       Update of Hacksaw to a Rackmount Server

With a single cpu and less than 1 GB of RAM (due to DT3155 driver
limitations), hacksaw was buckling under the demands of running 
dozens of TCS servers, continuous logging and monitoring of
TCS systems, and the dozens of windows that operators use to control
everything.  Splitting the TCS server duties off to a dedicated
machine would go a long way towards improving the responsiveness of
the operator's desktop.  Since we've had very good luck with our
mmto.org rackmount server from ASL, we acquired a similar system to
become the new hacksaw.  It has dual dual-core opteron cpus, 2 GB of
RAM, and 3 TB of RAID5 disk spanning 11 drives plus a 12th as a hot
spare.  This will provide us plenty of room for our growing data
archiving and analysis needs.

The new machine was deployed as hacksaw and the former hacksaw renamed
to yggdrasil during the last week of August.  This gave us some
engineering time to iron out the kinks and weed out implicit and
explicit assumptions about hostnames and where operators are logged
in.  This mostly involved boot configurations for vxworks crates, but
also the cell rerr window and the operator log screenshot mechanism.
These issues were successfully worked around and we now seem to be
running smoothly with the new configuration.  We are now in a position
to deal with a failure of a control room computer much more smoothly
and easily.  Any one of them will be able to run all TCS interfaces
nearly equally well.  In the case of a failure of hacksaw, the
mmto.org server downtown can easily be reconfigured on the fly to
respond to hacksaw's ip number and run all of the TCS services that
hacksaw hosts.  


    DONUT: A Method for Wavefront Sensing using Out-of-Focus Stars

A recent paper by A. Tokovinin and S. Heathcote (astro-ph/0606388)
describes a method for measuring wavefront aberrations using single
images of out-of-focus stars.  The ability to do wavefront sensing
with single CCD frames and no extra hardware is a potentially very
powerful tool.  One obvious application for the MMT would be to
quickly measure aberrations across a megacam field.  The results
of that can then be analyzed to determine alignment errors between M1,
M2, and the WFC.  Another possible application would be continuous
wavefront sensing for f/9 using one of the guider cameras.  

The authors made available an IDL implementation of this method which
we have been trying out.  It seems to work well, is easy to use, and
is easily modified to support the MMT's optical specifications.  A
drawback of this method is that its iterative nature makes it somewhat
computationally intensive.  However, we have found that even the IDL
implementation only takes at most a few seconds to converge on a
solution.  During engineering time in September we hope to take data
at f/9 and f/5 to compare results between DONUT and our existing
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors.  


      Making a Low-End SBIG CCD Into a High-Speed Seeing Camera

Measuring seeing with a DIMM or similar instrument requires a detector
that is capable of taking exposures short enough to "freeze" the
atmosphere as much as possible.  For a standard DIMM short enough is
generally 5-10 ms.  This is possible with inexpensive CCDs with
mechanical shutters, but the turnaround time between exposures is
often of order a few hundred ms or more.  This is fine for determining
seeing from a two aperture DIMM, but better temporal sampling is
required to fully take advantage of a multi-aperture Hartmann-DIMM.  

A solution would be to leave the shutter open and read the CCD out
continuously.  This way the exposure time would be limited by the
readout speed of the CCD and there would be continuous sampling from
exposure to exposure.  The resulting image would have long strips for
each aperture.  Atmospheric turbulence parameters can then be derived
from the RMS deviations from the average strip positions.  The
continuous sampling would make it possible to bin the strips to
determine exposure time corrections.  

CCD cameras from SBIG provide the capability of reading out while
exposing, a feature widely used by amateur astronomers to do drift
scan imaging.  We obtained the smallest SBIG camera, the ST-402, since
it has all of the sensitivity and features of the larger cameras and
we don't need a large field.  As a bonus the camera comes with an
internal RGB+Clear filter wheel making color imaging possible.  A
sample image taken during software testing is shown in Figure 1.  The
software to do the continuously exposed readout is mostly completed
and we hope to do some on-sky testing of it this fall.

images of equal exposure time with a ST-402 camera.  


	      OS and Software Updates for Linux Machines

All of the mountain machines with the exception of yggdrasil have been
upgraded from Fedora Core 4 to 5.  It and mmto.org will be updated
later in September.  Two floating licenses for IDL 6.3 were purchased
for observatory use and IDL installed on all of the observatory's
linux workstations.  


 IDL Tool for Visualizing and Analyzing the Thermal Properties of the
			    Primary Mirror

Betty Stobie has developed an IDL visualization program to:

      - read E-series thermocouple values from a file
      - plot the values for the sets of thermocouples in the front, middle, and
	back plates
      - select which of the sets to plot and control the temperature
	range for the plots
      - fit the front, middle, and back values with 9 coefficient
	Zernike polynomials
      - display the fitted surfaces for each plate
      - calculate and display the focus correction predicted by FEA
	modeling done by T. Pickering.
      - output all fitted results to the designated log files
      - print view of the raw data display or the fitted image display by
	creating .png or .eps files

The user may select the desired thermocouple data file to read or process
a list of data files where a timer controls the delay between the reading 
of each file in the list.  Remaining items to implement include:

      - read the thermocouple values from the cell mini-server on
	hacksaw.  The timer will control the delay between reads of the socket.
      - create a save file so that draw_temp can run in the IDL virtual
	environment which does not require an IDL license.

Screenshots of the raw data and surface fit displays are shown in
Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 (draw_old.png): Screenshot showing the raw data display.  The
outer circle denotes the front plate, the middle the mid plate, and
the inner circle the back plate.  Clicking on a thermocouple position
will display the temperatures at that position in the 3 plates along
with their deviations from the mean mirror temperature.

Figure 3 (image_old.png): Screenshot showing the surface fit display.
When the cursor is moved within one of the three images, the
calculated temperature from the fit at that position is displayed.

	     Online Observer Catalog Submission Webpage.

A new observer catalog submission webpage is now online on the MMT
website for observers to utilize. This tool will help observers submit
their existing catalogs or generate new catalogs from scratch. The
page allows for observers to type in a target name (such as Vega or
M45) and that target's RA, DEC and proper motion are all
automatically generated and added to the catalog. This works by making
a connection under-the-hood (using a combination of Ajax & SOAP) to
the SIMBAD database. The catalog format is interchangeable with other
Steward Observatory telescopes so even non-MMT observers can also
utilize this tool to generate their own catalogs if
desired.  The URL is http://hacksaw.mmto.arizona.edu/catalogs/


		    HORIZONS Ephemerides TCS Tool

To help make tracking non-sidereal targets easier, a new tool has been
developed for the MMT Telescope Control System. The MMT Horizons
Ephemerides tool accepts a name of a non-sidereal object, it then
establishes a connection behind the scenes (using PHP CURL & Ajax) to
NASA JPLÕs Solar System Dynamics database to generate a 1 minute
interval ephemeris for any desired time span. Modifications have been
made to the Mount crate to accept this new ephemeris table and to
perform the interpolation of the ephemeris table.
